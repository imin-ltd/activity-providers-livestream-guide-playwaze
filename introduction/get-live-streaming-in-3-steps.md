###  🏇 The Quick Guide to Live Streaming

1. \*\*\*\*[**Choose a live streaming platform**](../how-to-set-up-for-living-streaming/your-tech-set-up/choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/)**.** If you want to run an interactive session, [set up with Zoom](../how-to-set-up-for-living-streaming/your-tech-set-up/choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/using-zoom.md). Otherwise you can use [Facebook Live](../how-to-set-up-for-living-streaming/your-tech-set-up/choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/using-facebook-live.md), [Instagram Live](../how-to-set-up-for-living-streaming/your-tech-set-up/choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/using-instagram-live.md) or [YouTube Live](../how-to-set-up-for-living-streaming/your-tech-set-up/choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/using-youtube-live.md). 
2. \*\*\*\*[**Add your live stream session into a class management system or booking system that is OpenActive enabled**.](../how-to-set-up-for-living-streaming/getting-your-class-out-there/increasing-the-visibility-of-your-live-streamed-classes.md) That's because your class will then be published, for free, across many, many platforms that will promote your class to their millions of users. If you want something simple and free-to-use to get going with, you can use one of the [free tools listed here](../how-to-set-up-for-living-streaming/getting-your-class-out-there/increasing-the-visibility-of-your-live-streamed-classes.md#examples-of-openactive-enabled-class-management-booking-systems) whilst you explore if any of the other options are worth switching to later on.  
3. **Run an awesome session** like only you know how  **💪**
