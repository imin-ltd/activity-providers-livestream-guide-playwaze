# üíª Why live stream your classes?

### üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Community

A sense of community is so important right now, so it may not be all about the exercise. A lot of people will just be craving social interaction at the moment. By joining a live stream class, you members will feel a part of something bigger.

### üìà Opportunity

**Silver lining \#1:** there has never been a better time to be a fitness professional confined to your home. So many digital tools and solutions will help you easily make the transition to online classes. So think of this as a great opportunity to engage with so many new people - people who might never have attended one of your in-person classes.

**Silver lining \#2:** according to some [research by Facebook](https://about.fb.com/news/2016/03/news-feed-fyi-taking-into-account-live-video-when-ranking-feed/), on average people spend upwards of 3x more time watching a Facebook Live video compared to a video that is no longer live. Why? Because Facebook Live videos are more interesting in the moment than after the fact.

**Silver lining \#3:** it‚Äôs not very often that we get such an incredible opportunity to improve our offering so drastically. This is a chance for you to step out of your comfort zone \(if you're new to this\), hone your coaching skills and think about becoming a better coach. Once things return to normal and we go back to our normal routines, your experience of delivering live stream classes online might well benefit your business in the long term. Who knows, you might have to continue with your online classes to serve the people who can't attend in person.

### üëè Motivation

Why do people choose live stream rather than on-demand classes? Besides the community-aspect, it is because it provides a sense of routine for them: it is a reason for them to get up at 7:50am for the 8am pilates class; it forces them to step away from their emails for forty-five minutes of HIIT over lunch; it is an hour of yoga that they can look forward to after the home-schooled kids are in bed. You motivate them.

What's more, depending on your choice of [live stream solution](../how-to-set-up-for-living-streaming/your-tech-set-up/choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/), this is a 2-way relationship. People will watch you, but you can interact with people as they workout in your class. You can still provide advice and tips, and the words of encouragement that people still crave. You motivate them.

And finally, let's not forget, this is a challenging time for you as a trainer. A lot of change and need to adapt. You will get immediate feedback from the people in your live stream class - we guarantee you that the huge round of applause from oodles of houses at the end of a workout will inspire you into your next class. _They_ motivate _you._
