# Increasing the visibility of your live streamed classes

Whichever live stream solution you use, and whether you use a class management / booking system or not, you'll want to maximise the number of people finding out about your classes. This is perhaps more important than ever, because an increasing number of people are searching online for classes that are suitable for them, so you need to get your classes as much visibility as possible.

### üéâ Introducing OpenActive

[OpenActive](https://www.openactive.io/) is here to support you to reach a wider audience. OpenActive is a Government funded initiative designed to make it far easier for you to work with multiple partners to promote your classes to as many people as possible.

Put simply:  

1. You have classes that you want in front of as many people as possible. 
2. There are various for-profit and not-for-profit platforms out there that want to promote your classes to their collective user base. 
3. OpenActive is the simple, standardised way for you to share live information about your upcoming classes with all of those platforms simultaneously.

Examples of the platforms that want to promote your classes are: Decathlon, Sport England, Ordnance Survey and many more. Cumulatively, they have a reach of millions of users every month, and they want to put your classes in front of those users. In most cases, your classes are promoted for free and without any extra effort from you once you're setup.

#### Sounds great! How do I make it happen?

The straight forward answer is to do two things:

* Use a booking / class management system to manage your classes; and
* Ensure the system you choose is "OpenActive enabled".

In reality the steps might vary depending on your existing setup. For example:

* **If you already use a booking system**: you should ask them if they are OpenActive enabled. We've listed some below that are. If yours isn't, please email hello@openactive.io and they can help liaise with the system to see if they can become compliant. 
* **If your existing system isn't ready to become OpenActive enabled:** then you can either [use one of the systems below](increasing-the-visibility-of-your-live-streamed-classes.md#examples-of-openactive-enabled-class-management-booking-systems) _in addition_ to your current system \(although it's not recommended, as it doubles the effort for you to maintain information in both places\) ****or you might want to switch to using an OpenActive enabled system as your main system. 
* **You don't yet use a system:** Great! That's the best position to be in - [choose one of the systems](increasing-the-visibility-of-your-live-streamed-classes.md#examples-of-openactive-enabled-class-management-booking-systems) below  and you're off!

#### I already work with MoveGB, ClassPass or something similar. How is this different?

Great question! ü§ì OpenActive is an enabler of these types of platforms. Instead of having to upload your class timetable information, and keep it up to date, in every fitness marketplace platform, you should be able to share that information directly from your existing booking system.

Some booking systems have direct integrations with fitness marketplaces \(e.g. the MindBody booking system integrates with ClassPass\) so your timetables _are_ shared directly. But if you wanted to switch booking systems, or use multiple fitness marketplaces, you'd be limited to direct integrations are available. OpenActive **standardises** the way fitness marketplaces and booking systems integrate with each other, meaning that it's easier for a booking system to integrate with many fitness marketplaces. This ultimately means you have more choice in which booking system to use, and each booking system should be able to seamlessly connect you to a wider spectrum of fitness marketplaces.
