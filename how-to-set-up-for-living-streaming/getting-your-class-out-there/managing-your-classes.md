# Managing your classes

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Managing your classes

If you are managing quite a few classes, want to build a relationship with your participants and / or want to take bookings and payments, then having a booking system is a great idea!

You may not need a class management / booking system if you don't need to take bookings or payments, don't need help managing multiple classes, and just want to get on with live streaming your classes direct to your audience on Facebook or Instagram. However, there's still an opportunity to [increase the exposure of your classes](increasing-the-visibility-of-your-live-streamed-classes.md).

#### If you already use a class management or booking system:

If you already use a booking system - great! Your booking system may already have a helpful guide to live stream your classes, or even have a partnership / integration with a live streaming solution like Zoom, so it's worth having a look as that will probably be your easiest option. 

Some booking systems leave the choice of live streaming solution to you - in which case you can use the previous pages to select what live streaming solution works best for you. When you have the live stream URL for the class \(e.g. Zoom Meeting URL, YouTube Live URL, etc.\), you can add it into the appropriate place in your booking system or send it in an email to your booked participants before the class.

If it isn't obvious how to use live streaming solutions with your current booking system, send us a note at hello@imin.co and we'd be happy to help.

#### If you don't use a booking system yet, but you want to:

There are booking systems of all shapes and sizes out there for you to choose from. You should read the section about increasing the visibility of your classes before making a final choice on which system you choose:
