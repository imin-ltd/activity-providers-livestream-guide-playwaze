# 👟Put yourself in their exercise shoes

### 🏠 Environment

You need to be mindful of the possible limitations on space. People might be in their bedroom, their living room, maybe even in a garden - so maybe remove the shuttle runs from your workout for the time being! Ask people before you start the class to make sure the surrounding area is free of obstacles and hazards - a space about 2m² should be fine.

### 🏋️‍♀️ Equipment

You also need to remember that people may not have access to the equipment that you have. Some might have dumbbells or fitness bands; others might have nothing. So can you do a workout without equipment? Or if you absolutely do need it, can you be creative and help people use common household objects? Will a can of baked beans suffice as a weight or a chair as a step? If people will need equipment for classes going forward, then you can send a link to the online retailer from which they can order for delivery \(but remember - people are watching the pennies at this difficult time!\).

### 🤳 Engaging

There is plenty of highly polished recorded content out there. But understand that you might be the only person that people have interacted with all day. Try to engage with them in such a way that, regardless of whether they are a first-timer or a regular, they want to come back. You may want to **limit** class space to only as many as you can give feedback to, to maintain high engagement and quality levels.

### 🖼 Entire body in frame

This is very important: can people see your entire body? When you go down to do a press-up, do people lose sight of you? People need to be able to see what you’re doing at all times. So make sure you camera is pointing in the right place and you are far enough away to incorporate all of your movements. For more detail about this, see:
