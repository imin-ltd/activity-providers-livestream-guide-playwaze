# 🤔 Other things to consider

### 🤐 To mute or not to mute

Some instructors choose to start the class off muted - this might be helpful for a yoga class where you’re trying to create a relaxed environment. Others want a bit of chit-chat in the build up. Just remember that some platforms default to the user who is currently speaking. So during your class you might want to mute all of the participants so that only your camera is being focused on, or "pin" your camera as the main video feed.

### 💬 Questions

If people have any questions during the class and everyone is muted, make people aware that at the start they can type them into the chat so you can read them. That way you can answer the question, which might be something other people are thinking anyway.

### 🚫 Cameras off

Remember, some people might prefer to have their camera off. This is nothing against you - they just might not want their home on the video or may be embarrassed as it’s their first time. Helpful words of encouragement is sure to help their confidence.
