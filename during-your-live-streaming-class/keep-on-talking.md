  are still with you and in the class.

# 🗣 Keep on talking

### 📣 Stay vocal

You might be the vocal type. You might opt for a more relaxed approach to leading a class. During a live stream class, remember to always let people know you'll still there and with them. It helps to be as vocal as possible. Try to keep talking - reassure the people that you are still there.

### 🧐 Survey your class

Stand back and watch people’s form - don’t continually be working. If you stop and observe, people will appreciate this - this is probably why they joined the class. You could start people off on an exercise and then offer feedback \(individual or group\) by looking at people's videos. Give them feedback on their effort levels or form, which will reinforce the idea of community.

### ➕ Be positive

Focus on positivity: “Great squat! Good form!” You want to provide positive feedback and helpful encouragement without making people feel like they’re being shouted at for an hour in their own home. Unless that’s your style, in which case make that known at the start and in your session descriptions.

### 🥳 Celebrate together

This is no different to an in-person class. People have had to make the effort and motivate themselves to be there with you. So, at the end of your class, don’t forget to get everyone to do a big round of applause. Celebrate the accomplishments of each and every one of them!
