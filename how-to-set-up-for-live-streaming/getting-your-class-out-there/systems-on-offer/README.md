### üìΩ Class management/booking systems and your streaming solution

Some class management/booking systems leave the choice of live streaming solution to you - in which case you can use the previous section on[ choosing a live streaming solution](../../your-tech-set-up/choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/) to select the one that will work best for you.

When you have the live stream URL for the class \(e.g. Zoom Meeting URL, YouTube Live URL, etc.\), you can add it into the appropriate place/relevant field in your chosen system or send it in an email to those booked on before the class.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your class management or booking system may already have a helpful guide to live stream your classes, or even have a partnership/integration with a live streaming solution like Zoom.

It's worth having a look as that will probably be your easiest option.
{% endhint %}

If it isn't obvious how to use live streaming solutions with your current system, send us a note at hello@imin.co and we'd be happy to help.
