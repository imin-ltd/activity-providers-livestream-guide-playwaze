# 🎯 Some top tips to send you on your way

🎭 Do a dress rehearsal before your first class - this will help you focus on your workout and not your equipment during your real classes. Start small and build up to bigger classes.

🤸‍♀️ Make sure people can see all your movements. You don't want your torso being cut off during a burpee!

🔐 Don't forget to provide people with the link \(and password if necessary\) to your online class, allowing plenty of time for them to get set up and join.

🗣 Be as vocal as possible during the class - reassure people that you are still there and their connection has not failed.

🙋‍♀️ Give group or individual feedback on their effort levels and form - this will reinforce the idea of community.

🎉 Don't forget to celebrate at the end of the workout - whoop, cheer, shout!

🤷‍♂️ Be prepared for mistakes to happen. But be prepared to grow from the experience.

👩‍👧‍👦 Encourage people to share physical activity and movement with their family members - after all, we’re all in this together!

🔋 Above all, remember that at this difficult and uncertain time, you can offer an escape from the new normal. You are in a position of great power. Now go forth and help get active \(virtually\)!
